# Voicemeeter

Control Voicemeeter Strips and Buses via midi-mixer. Works with Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato


## Installing
To install without compiling from source, download the [.midiMixerPlugin from the latest release](https://github.com/Jaggernaut555/midi-mixer-voicemeeter/releases) and double click the file.

If you've previously set up loopMIDI or similar software to pass midi commands through to Voicemeeter check that they are not conflicting with the fader/knob assignments used by the plugin.

This plugin was made with VoiceMeeter Potato version 3.0.2.1 (Banana version 2.0.6.1 and non-named version 1.0.8.1). Lower versions may not work correctly.

- [midi-mixer-plugin](https://github.com/midi-mixer/midi-mixer-plugin)
