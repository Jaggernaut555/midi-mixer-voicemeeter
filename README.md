# Voicemeeter

Control Voicemeeter Strips and Busses via midi-mixer. Works with Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato


## Installing
To install without compiling from source, download the [.midiMixerPlugin from the latest release](https://github.com/Jaggernaut555/midi-mixer-voicemeeter/releases) and double click the file.

If you've previously set up loopMIDI or similar software to pass midi commands through to Voicemeeter check that they are not conflicting with the fader/knob assignments used by the plugin.



This package uses:
- [midi-mixer-plugin](https://github.com/midi-mixer/midi-mixer-plugin)
- [ts-easy-voicemeeter-remote](https://github.com/jaggernaut5555/ts-easy-voicemeeter-remote)
