# Voicemeeter

Control Voicemeeter Strips and Busses via midi-mixer. Works with Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato

This allows you to change the Gain, mute, and solo of all Voicemeeter strips and busses.

Solo is set to the "running" button for all strip assignments. The "assign" button is the same as the "sel" button for busses on the Potato verison.

## Troubleshooting
If you've previously set up loopMIDI or similar software to pass midi commands through to Voicemeeter check that they are not conflicting with the fader/knob assignments used by the plugin.

This plugin was made with VoiceMeeter Potato version 3.0.2.1 (Banana version 2.0.6.1 and non-named version 1.0.8.1). Lower versions may not work correctly.


Latest releases of this plugin available [on the project's github page](https://github.com/Jaggernaut555/midi-mixer-voicemeeter/releases/latest)
