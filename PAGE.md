# Voicemeeter

Control Voicemeeter Strips and Busses via midi-mixer. Works with Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato

This allows you to change the Gain, mute, and solo of all Voicemeeter strips and busses.

Solo is set to the "running" button for all strip assignments.

## Troubleshooting
If you've previously set up loopMIDI or similar software to pass midi commands through to Voicemeeter check that they are not conflicting with the fader/knob assignments used by the plugin.



Latest releases of this plugin available [on the project's github page](https://github.com/Jaggernaut555/midi-mixer-voicemeeter/releases/latest)
